      <description>It was February 2012 when I was meant to take a flight from a foggy Treviso Airport direction London Stansted. The fog created several problems, all passengers were taken by bus to Venice and we had to wait 3 hours before boarding on the plane. The flight ðŸ›¬ landed with an overall 4h of delay, not great if the scheduled arrival time was 8PM! I then caught a bus to Liverpool street and finally got lost while trying to reach my hotel.</description>
