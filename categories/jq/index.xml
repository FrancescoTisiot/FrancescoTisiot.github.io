      <description>I was working on some demos recently on the Apache Kafka source connectors (hi #KafkaSummit!), and trying to display the stream of changes in the resulting Apache Kafka topic.
My standard approach is to vertically divide the terminal and have on the left the database connection where I can issue commands and on the right the output of kcat. This setup works really well for simple messages, but when using it with a Debezium source connector, the amount of fields pushed in a single message makes it hardly parsable by a live audience watching a screen.</description>
